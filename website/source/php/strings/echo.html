notes:
  - >-
    In 1.3.2 and earlier, this function wrote to the body of the document when
    it

    was called in webbrowsers, in addition to supporting XUL.

    This involved >100 lines of boilerplate to do this in a safe way.

    Since I can't imageine a complelling use-case for this, and XUL is
    deprecated

    I have removed this behavior in favor of just calling `console.log`
  - >-
    You'll see functions depends on `echo` instead of `console.log` as we'll
    want

    to have 1 contact point to interface with the outside world, so that it's
    easy

    to support other ways of printing output.
