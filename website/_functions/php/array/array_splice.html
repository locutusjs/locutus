    Order does get shifted in associative array input with numeric indices,
    since PHP behavior doesn't preserve keys, but I understand order is
    not reliable anyways
    Note also that IE retains information about property position even
    after being supposedly deleted, so use of this function may produce
    unexpected results in IE if you later attempt to add back properties
    with the same keys that had been deleted
