# Log

LLMs log key learnings, progress, and next steps in one `### Iteration ${incrementing number}` for every invocation. A new invocation can check if the last iteration was concluded correctly, update it if needed, and then open a new one.

## Rules

- An iteration starts with a level 3 heading: `### Iteration ${incrementing number}`
- An iteration contains the datetime, and a list of bullet points
- Every 10 iterations must be summarized and compacted into one list of bullet points, e.g. `### Iterations 1-10`.
- If you write to this file and find any violation, revise this document to make it adhere

### Iterations

### Iterations 1-10
